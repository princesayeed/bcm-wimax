## What is it? ##

bcm-wimax is a project for enabling Beceem Chipset based 4G WiMAX USB Modems on Linux-based operating systems. (For noobs, Banglalion Driver for Linux)

## Why would I use it? ##

If you are a Linux user and a Banglalion user at the same time, you can use this driver set for using you 4G Modem on Linux to enjoy the freedom of Linux and the Internet at the same time.

## Who made it? ##

The code used here was actually produced by Beceem itself for developers. I, the developer of this suite modified and configured it to work with Banglalion's USB Modems for using in Bangladesh.

Aniruddha Adhikary is the developer of this modified driver suite. So, I did not MAKE it, just modified it.

## How does this relate to Banglalion Communications Ltd? ##

  * This code helps their branded USB Modems to run on Linux.
  * The code has **nothing** to do with Banglalion Communications Ltd. They are not responsible for this project.
  * Banglalion Communications Ltd will not provide support for this driver (the community and we, will).
  * Banglalion **is and was not** (probably never will be) any how involved in the development of this driver.
